= Build rich JavaScript applications with WordPress and GraphQL =

WPGraphQL allows you to separate your CMS from your presentation layer. Content creators can use the CMS they know, while developers can use the frameworks and tools they love.

WPGraphQL works great with:

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- ...and more

= Query what you need. Get exactly that. =

With GraphQL, the client makes declarative queries, asking for the exact data needed, and in exactly what was asked for is given in response, nothing more. This allows the client have control over their application, and allows the GraphQL server to perform more efficiently by only fetching the resources requested.

= Fetch many resources in a single request. =

GraphQL queries allow access to multiple root resources, and also smoothly follow references between connected resources. While typical a REST API would require round-trip requests to many endpoints, GraphQL APIs can get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.

= Powerful Debugging Tools =

WPGraphQL ships with GraphiQL in your WordPress dashboard, allowing you to browse your site's GraphQL Schema and test Queries and Mutations.

= Upgrading =

It is recommended that anytime you want to update WPGraphQL that you get familiar with what's changed in the release.

WPGraphQL publishes [release notes on Github](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases).

WPGraphQL has been following Semver practices for a few years. We will continue to follow Semver and let version numbers communicate meaning. The summary of Semver versioning is as follows:

- *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes,
- *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- *PATCH* version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can read more about the details of Semver at semver.org

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use WPGraphQL with xx JavaScript Framework? =

WPGraphQL turns your WordPress site into a GraphQL API. Any client that can make http requests to the GraphQL endpoint can be used to interact with WPGraphQL.

= Where do I get WPGraphQL Swag? =

WPGraphQL Swag is available on the Gatsby Swag store.

= What's the relationship between Gatsby, WP Engine, and WPGraphQL? =

[WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/) is the employer of Jason Bahl, the creator and maintainer of WPGraphQL. He was previously employed by [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com).

You can read more about this [here](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2021/02/07/whats-next-for-wpgraphql/).

Gatsby and WP Engine both believe that a strong GraphQL API for WordPress is a benefit for the web. Neither Gatsby or WP Engine are required to be used with WPGraphQL, however it's important to acknowledge and understand what's possible because of their investments into WPGraphQL and the future of headless WordPress!

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.5.0 =

The `MenuItem.path` field was changed from `non-null` to nullable and some clients may need to make adjustments to support this.

= 1.4.0 =

The `uri` field was non-null on some Types in the Schema but has been changed to be nullable on all types that have it. This might require clients to update code to expect possible null values.

= 1.2.0 =

Composer dependencies are no longer versioned in Github. Recommended install source is WordPress.org or using Composer to get the code from Packagist.org or WPackagist.org.

== Changelog ==

= 1.3.0 =

**Noteable changes**

Between this release and the prior release ([v1.2.6](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases/tag/v1.2.6)) includes changes to pagination under the hood.

While these releases correcting mistakes and buggy behavior, it's possible that workarounds have already been implemented either in the server or in client applications.

For example, there was a bug with `start/end` cursors being reversed for backward pagination.

If a client application were reversing the cursors to fix the issue, the reversal in the client will now _cause_ the issue.

It's recommended to test your applications against this release, _specifically_ in regards to pagination.

- ([#1797](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1797)): Update test environment to allow custom permalink structures to be better tested.

**Bugfixes**

- ([#1676](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1676)) Add a `nav_menu_item` loader to allow previous menu item IDs to work properly with WPGraphQL should they be passed to a node query (like, if the ID were persisted somewhere already)

= 1.1.0 =

This release centers around updating code quality by implementing [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) checks. PHPStan is a tool that statically analyzes PHP codebases to detect bugs. This release centers around updating Docblocks and overall code quality, and implements automated tests to check code quality on every pull request.

**New**

- Update PHPStan (Code Quality checker) to v0.12.64
- Increases PHPStan code quality checks to Level 8 (highest level).

**Bugfixes**
- ([#1653](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/1653)) Fixes bug where WPGraphQL was explicitly setting `has_published_posts` on WP_Query but WP_Query does this under the hood already. Thanks @jmartinhoj!
- Fixes issue with Comment Model returning comments that are not associated with a Post object. Comments with no associated Post object are not public entities.
- Update docblocks to be compatible with PHPStan Level 8.
- Removed some uncalled code
- Added early returns in some places to prevent unnecessary added execution

= 1.0.5 =

**New**

- Updates GraphQL-PHP from v14.3.0 to v14.4.0

**Bugfixes**

- Fixes a bug where CI Tests were not passing when code coverage is enabled
- ([#1633](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1633)) Fixes bug where Introspection Queries were showing fields with no deprecationReason as deprecated because it was outputting an empty string instead of a null value.
- ([#1627](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1627)) Fixes bug where fields on the Model called multiple times might weren't being set properly
- Updates Theme tests to be more resilient for WP Core updates where new themes are introduced

= 1.0.4 =

- Fixes a regression to previews introduced by v1.0.3

= 1.0.3 =

**Bugfixes**

- ([#1623](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1623)): Queries for single posts will only return posts of that post_type
- ([#1624](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1624)): Passes Menu Item Labels through html_entity_decode

= 1.0.2 =

**Bugfixes**

- fix issue with using the count() function on potentially not-countable value
- fix bug where post_status was being checked instead of comment_status
- fix error message when restoring a comment doesn't work
- ([#1610](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/1610)) fix check to see if current user has permission to update another Author's post. Thanks @maximilianschmidt!

= 1.0.1 =

**Bugfixes**
- ([#1589](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1589)) Fixes a php type bug in TypeRegistry.php. Thanks @szepeviktor!
- [Fixes bug](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/compare/master...release/v1.0.1?expand=1#diff-74d71c4d1f9d84b9b0d946ca96eb875274f95d60611611d84cc01cdf6ed04021) with how GraphQL PHP Debug flags are set.
- ([#1598](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/1598)) Fixes bug where Post Types registered with the same graphql_single_name and graphql_plural_name are the same value.
- ([#1615](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/1615)) Fixes bug where fields added to the Schema that that were using get_post_meta() for Previews weren't always resolving properly.

**New Features**
- Adds a setting to allow users to opt-in to tracking active installs of WPGraphQL.
- Removed old docs that used to be in this repo as markdown. Docs are now written in WordPress and the wpgraphql.com is a Gatsby site built from the content in WordPress and the [code in this repo](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com). Looking to contribute content to the docs? Open an issue on this repo or the wpgraphql.com repo and we'll work with you to get content updated. We have future plans to allow the community to contribute by writing content in the WordPress install, but for now, Github issues will do.
