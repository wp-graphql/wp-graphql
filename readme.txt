= Build rich JavaScript applications with WordPress and GraphQL =

WPGraphQL allows you to separate your CMS from your presentation layer. Content creators can use the CMS they know, while developers can use the frameworks and tools they love.

WPGraphQL works great with:

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- ...and more

= Query what you need. Get exactly that. =

With GraphQL, the client makes declarative queries, asking for the exact data needed, and in exactly what was asked for is given in response, nothing more. This allows the client have control over their application, and allows the GraphQL server to perform more efficiently by only fetching the resources requested.

= Fetch many resources in a single request. =

GraphQL queries allow access to multiple root resources, and also smoothly follow references between connected resources. While typical a REST API would require round-trip requests to many endpoints, GraphQL APIs can get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.

= Powerful Debugging Tools =

WPGraphQL ships with GraphiQL in your WordPress dashboard, allowing you to browse your site's GraphQL Schema and test Queries and Mutations.

= Upgrading =

It is recommended that anytime you want to update WPGraphQL that you get familiar with what's changed in the release.

WPGraphQL publishes [release notes on Github](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases).

WPGraphQL has been following Semver practices for a few years. We will continue to follow Semver and let version numbers communicate meaning. The summary of Semver versioning is as follows:

- *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes,
- *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- *PATCH* version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can read more about the details of Semver at semver.org

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use WPGraphQL with xx JavaScript Framework? =

WPGraphQL turns your WordPress site into a GraphQL API. Any client that can make http requests to the GraphQL endpoint can be used to interact with WPGraphQL.

= Where do I get WPGraphQL Swag? =

WPGraphQL Swag is available on the Gatsby Swag store.

= What's the relationship between Gatsby and WPGraphQL? =

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) employs Jason Bahl, the creator and maintainer of WPGraphQL. Gatsby believes that a strong GraphQL API for WordPress is a benefit for the web. Gatsby makes no restrictions on how you use WPGraphQL, however Gatsby is investing a lot into making the Gatsby + WordPress experience a great one, and WPGraphQL is a central part of that experience.
