# WPGraphQL Cursor Rules

This directory contains project-specific rules for Cursor, an AI-powered code editor. These rules help the AI understand the structure and patterns of the WPGraphQL codebase.

## Rule Files

- **wpgraphql.json**: The main rule file that contains information about the WPGraphQL project, including frameworks, key concepts, file patterns, dependencies, and more.

## How These Rules Help

These rules provide context to the AI when working with the WPGraphQL codebase, enabling it to:

1. Understand the project structure and architecture
2. Recognize common code patterns
3. Identify key files and directories
4. Understand the purpose of different components
5. Provide more accurate and relevant suggestions

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to WPGraphQL and using Cursor, these rules will automatically be applied when you open the project in Cursor. This ensures that all contributors have the same context when working with the codebase.

## Updating Rules

If you need to update these rules, please modify the appropriate JSON file in this directory. Make sure to follow the existing structure and format.
