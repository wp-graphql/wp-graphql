  # ===========================================
  # TEST MATRIX
  # ===========================================
  # We use a "boundary testing" approach rather than testing every PHP × WP combination.
  # The rationale: if tests pass at version boundaries (oldest + newest), they almost
  # certainly pass for versions in between.
  #
  # - 4 coverage jobs: Latest WP/PHP with all theme × multisite combos
  # - 3 boundary jobs: Current stable, mid-range, oldest supported
  # - 1 experimental: WordPress trunk (allowed to fail)
  #
  # Update this matrix when new WP/PHP versions are released:
  # - WordPress releases ~3x/year: https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/
  # - PHP support: https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php
  # - WP PHP requirements: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-target-versions/

  # Last updated: 2026-01-21

  # Job naming strategy:

  # - Child job name: "theme (modifiers)" (from reusable workflow)
  # - Full name in branch protection: "Integration: wp-graphql / WP 6.9 / PHP 8.4 / twentytwentyfive 📊"
