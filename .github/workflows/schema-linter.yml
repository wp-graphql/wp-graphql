    # Matrix strategy to lint schemas for each plugin
    # 
    # To add a new plugin:
    # 1. Add a new entry to the include array below
    # 2. Set component to match the release tag prefix (from release-please-config.json)
    # 3. Set active_plugins to comma-separated list of plugins needed for schema generation
    # 4. If the plugin requires additional setup (e.g., installing dependencies, importing data),
    #    add a step after "Configure active plugins" to handle it
    #
    # Example for wpgraphql-acf (when added to monorepo):
    # - component: wp-graphql-acf
    #   plugin_path: plugins/wp-graphql-acf
    #   composer_working_dir: plugins/wp-graphql
    #   active_plugins: "wp-graphql,wp-graphql-acf"
