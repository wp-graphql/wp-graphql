# ===========================================
# SMOKE TEST WORKFLOW
# ===========================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# Validates the production zip artifact works correctly by:
# 1. Building the plugin zip (same as release process)
# 2. Installing it in a clean WordPress environment
# 3. Running smoke tests to verify core functionality
#
# This catches issues that unit tests might miss:
# - Missing files from .distignore
# - Build/bundling problems
# - Activation errors
# - Missing dependencies in production
#
# LOCAL USAGE:
# For basic smoke testing against your running wp-env:
#   npm run wp-env start
#   ./bin/smoke-test.sh
#
# To test the production zip artifact (mimicking CI):
#   See docs/TESTING.md#testing-the-production-zip-artifact
