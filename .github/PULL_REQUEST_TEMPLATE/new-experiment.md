## Implementation Summary

<!--
### Experiment Class
- [ ] Created `{ExperimentName}Experiment` class extending `AbstractExperiment`
- [ ] Implemented required methods (`get_config()`, `init()`, etc.)
- [ ] Added proper PHPDoc documentation
- [ ] Registered in `ExperimentRegistry::register_experiments()`

### Core Changes
- [ ] New GraphQL types/fields (when experiment is enabled)
- [ ] New resolvers/loaders
- [ ] New mutations (if applicable)
- [ ] Configuration options
- [ ] Database changes (if any)

### Schema Changes (when enabled)
```graphql
# New types that appear when experiment is active
type NewType {
  field: String
}

# New fields on existing types
type ExistingType {
  newField: String
}
```
-->

## Testing Strategy

<!--
### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for experiment class
- [ ] Integration tests for GraphQL queries (when enabled)
- [ ] Tests for experiment activation/deactivation
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Performance testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests verify no core functionality breaks when disabled

### Test Examples
```graphql
# Example queries that work when experiment is enabled
query TestExperimentFeature {
  # ...
}
```
-->

## Experiment Lifecycle

<!--
### Activation/Deactivation
- [ ] Experiment can be enabled via WordPress admin
- [ ] Experiment can be enabled via `GRAPHQL_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` constant
- [ ] Experiment can be enabled via `graphql_experimental_features_override` filter
- [ ] Disabling experiment returns site to stable behavior
- [ ] No errors when toggling experiment on/off

### Breaking Changes
Since experiments can have breaking changes, document any:
- [ ] Schema changes that break existing queries
- [ ] Behavior changes that affect existing functionality
- [ ] Migration path for users (if applicable)
-->

## Documentation Updates

<!--
### Documentation Changes
- [ ] Inline code documentation (PHPDoc blocks)
- [ ] Experiment README (if applicable)
- [ ] User-facing documentation for enabling/using the experiment
- [ ] Examples of GraphQL queries
- [ ] Known limitations or caveats

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Graduation plan (how this might become a core feature)
- [ ] Deprecation plan (if this might be removed)
- [ ] Community feedback collection strategy
-->

Please add any additional context that would be helpful:
- Screenshots of the experiment in action (GraphiQL IDE, admin settings)
- Performance impact analysis
- Security considerations
- Dependencies on other experiments (if any)
- Community feedback received during proposal phase
