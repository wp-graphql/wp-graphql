## What bug does this fix? Explain your changes.



This PR updates the minimum \`node\` version used by nvmrc and CI to v22, and Composer + NPM deps to their latest SemVer-compatible versions*.

Additionally, the \`npm run lint:php:fix\` command was fixed to correctly call \`composer fix-cs\`


This PR **does not** attempt to update any deps that require breaking changes, or FE dependencies related to Graphiql IDE and other parallel efforts, nor does it fix the preexisting (failing) E2E test.

## Does this close any currently open issues?
