## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR fixes a code quality bug where the \`do_graphql_request\` was incorrectly being called via \`add_filter()\` instead of \`add_action()\`. 

As a result of this change, the \`Tracing::init_trace()\` has been changed from returning a \`float\` unused by the application to returning \`void\`.

This is _technically_ a breaking change, as that method is public, and the Tracing class is not marked \`final\`. However, there doesn't seem to be a way _in_ WPGraphQL to replace this version with an extended version (unlike some other filterable classes).

## Does this close any currently open issues?



Not directly, but if we consider this a breaking change than it's part of #3370 . Converting the entire class to \`final\` would be part of that ticket for sure.

## Any other comments?
