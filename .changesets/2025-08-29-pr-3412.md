## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

The release workflow was deleting changesets on master after the release, then syncing master back to develop, which included the changeset deletions. This caused subsequent PRs from develop to include unwanted changeset deletions.

Fixed by:
- Moving changeset deletion to happen on develop BEFORE merging to master
- Removing the post-release changeset deletion step on master
- Adding comments explaining the change

This ensures changesets are cleaned up without affecting future PRs.

## Does this close any currently open issues?

closes #3411
