## What dependencies does this update? Explain your changes.

This PR bumps \`lucatume/wp-browser\` to \`^3.7\` and \`codeception/module-rest\` to \`^2.0\`. Unnecessary or already-included \`codeception/*\` libraries have been removed.

As a result, failing tests due to the stricter hygiene requirements have been updated.
