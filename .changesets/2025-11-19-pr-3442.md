## What maintenance tasks does this perform? Explain your changes.

I noticed we have a \`netlify.toml\` file and it's also listed in the \`.distignore\`, but we no longer deploy to Netlify (the docs site used to exist on Netlify, but was never cleaned up). I did a quick audit and found a few other orphaned files and entries that should be cleaned up.

**Files deleted:**
- \`netlify.toml\` - Docs site isn't on Netlify anymore, no references in codebase
- \`.codeclimate.yml\` - No references found anywhere

**Cleaned up \`.distignore\`:**
Removed entries for files that don't actually exist:
- \`.babel.config.cjs\` - Babel is handled by \`@wordpress/scripts\`
- \`.gitattributes\` - File doesn't exist (used to be used before deploying to WordPress.org)
- \`.github_changelog_generator\` - File doesn't exist  (intended to use, but went with custom \`release.yml\` workflow)
- \`jest.config.js\` - Jest is handled by \`@wordpress/scripts\` 
- \`netlify.toml\` - Now deleted (used to deploy docs to Netlify)
- \`.codeclimate.yml\` - Now deleted (used to use the GitHub app but no longer do)

## Maintenance Changes

**Files Modified:**
- \`netlify.toml\` - Deleted (used to deploy docs to Netlify, but no longer do)
- \`.codeclimate.yml\` - Deleted (used to use the GitHub App, but no longer do)
- \`.distignore\` - Removed 6 orphaned entries

This just makes the repo a bit cleaner and less confusing. No one needs to wonder why files are listed in \`.distignore\` that don't exist.

## Testing Strategy

Verified:
- Build process: \`composer run zip\` still works (and installing/executing the plugin from that .zip still works)
- \`.distignore\`: All remaining entries point to existing files/directories
- Code search: No references to deleted files found

## Impact Assessment

There should be no impact on WPGraphQL functionality - this is just cleanup. No functional / breaking changes.
