## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
When meta is stored as serialize array in post meta table, during preview instead of returning array it returns first value from array.

When \`$single\` is true, WordPress core's \`get_post_metadata\` filter returns the first value from an array. This fix ensures proper array wrapping to return array back when stored value is array.
