## What maintenance tasks does this perform? Explain your changes.

This PR adds Codecov alongside our existing Coveralls integration so we can evaluate both services side-by-side before deciding which to keep long-term.

Resolves #3462

## Maintenance Changes

### Type of Changes
- [x] CI/CD pipeline improvements
- [x] Code quality tool updates

### Files Modified
- \`.github/workflows/testing-integration.yml\` - Added Codecov action, fixed Coveralls path nesting with \`base-path\`
- \`codecov.yml\` - New config file with path fixes for Docker container paths

## Development Workflow Improvements

### What improvements does this provide?
- [x] Better error reporting
- Clean paths in coverage reports (fixes \`/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-graphql/\` nesting)
- Side-by-side comparison of coverage services

### Developer Experience
- Cleaner coverage reports make it easier to navigate and understand test coverage
- Better PR comments help reviewers understand coverage impact of changes

## Tooling Updates

### Tools/Processes Updated
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] Code coverage tools

### Configuration Changes
- Added \`codecov.yml\` with \`fixes\` directive to strip Docker container path prefix
- Added \`base-path\` to Coveralls action to fix the same path nesting issue
- Both services now receive coverage from the same test run for comparison

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] CI/CD pipeline tests pass

### Test Results
- Coverage will be uploaded to both Codecov and Coveralls
- Compare results at:
  - https://codecov.io/gh/wp-graphql/wp-graphql
  - https://coveralls.io/github/wp-graphql/wp-graphql

## Impact Assessment

### What is the impact of these changes?
- [x] No impact on WPGraphQL functionality
- [x] Improved development workflow
- [x] Better code quality

### Breaking Changes
- [x] No breaking changes

## Additional Context

- WPGraphQL previously used Codecov (2018-2020) before migrating from Travis CI to GitHub Actions
- Codecov is free for public open source repositories
- After evaluation, we'll remove whichever service we don't want to keep
