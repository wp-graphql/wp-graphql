## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This adds support for passing `graphql_description` when registering a Post Type or Taxonomy. This field will be used as the description in the Schema for the Type representing the Post Type or Taxonomy. 

In addition to adding support for the `graphql_description` arg, this also updates the descriptions for the built in post types and taxonomies, as well as the User, Menu and Comment types. 

|GraphQL Type | Current Description | Improved Description |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Category | "The category type" | "A taxonomy term that classifies content. Categories support hierarchy and can be used to create a nested structure." |
| Post | "The post type" | "A chronological content entry typically used for blog posts, news articles, or similar date-based content." |
| Page | "The page type" | "A standalone content entry generally used for static, non-chronological content such as About Us or Contact pages." |
| MediaItem | "The mediaItem type" | "Represents uploaded media, including images, videos, documents, and audio files." |
| User | "A User object" | "A registered user account. Users can be assigned roles, author content, and have various capabilities within the site." |
| Comment | "A Comment object" | "A response or reaction to content submitted by users. Comments are typically associated with a specific content entry." |
| Tag | "The tag type" | "A taxonomy term used to organize and classify content. Tags do not have a hierarchy and are generally used for more specific classifications." |
| PostFormat | "The postFormat type" | "A standardized classification system for content presentation styles. These formats can be used to display content differently based on type, such as "standard", "gallery", "video", etc." |
| Menu | "Menus are the containers for navigation items. Menus can be assigned to menu locations, which are typically registered by the active theme." | "Collections of navigation links. Menus can be assigned to designated locations and used to build site navigation structures." |
