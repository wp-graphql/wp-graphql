## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR updates the NPM dependencies to their latest _compatible_ versions, and cleans up the \`package.json\`

This is in prep of some long overdue cleanup and maintenance tasks that are now of slightly higher priority as they are getting in the way of/confusing code agents.

## Does this close any currently open issues?



## Any other comments?
