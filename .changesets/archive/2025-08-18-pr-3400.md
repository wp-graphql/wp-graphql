title: "refactor: prepare deprecations for v3 removal"

## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR prepares the groundwork for removing deprecated parts of the codebase in WPGraphQL v3.0,

- Moving deprecated classes into a new \`/deprecated\` directory (added by Composer ClassMap)
- _When sensible_, moving deprecated GraphQL types/fields/connections into a new \`WPGraphQL/Deprecated.php\` class.
- Updates _exisiting_ deprecation warnings to explicitly notify that they will be removed in the _next_ major release.

While code quality and cleanliness have always been nice - and a lot of these removals were already slated for 3.0, the impact of having this old code on agents and LLMs is becoming a major hinderance. So isolating things now and making it clearer that these things are not actually relevant to the codebase will be immediately helpful for both humans and ðŸ¤–

> !NOTE
> No **new** code has been deprecated. Only the messages on existing deprecations have been made more specific.
