## Shout Outs

- Special thanks to [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com) for allocating development resources to push the project forward.
- This plugin brings the power of GraphQL (http://graphql.org/) to WordPress.
- The plugin is built on top of the graphql-php library by Webonyx (https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php) and makes use 
of the graphql-relay-php library by Ivome (https://github.com/ivome/graphql-relay-php/)
- Some of the concepts and code are based on the WordPress Rest API. Much love to the folks (https://github.com/orgs/WP-API/people) 
that put their blood, sweat and tears into the WP-API project, as it's been huge in moving WordPress forward as a 
platform and helped inspire and direct the development of WPGraphQL.
- Much love to Facebook¬Æ for open sourcing the GraphQL spec (https://facebook.github.io/graphql/), the amazing GraphiQL 
dev tools (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), and maintaining the JavaScript GraphQL reference 
implementation (https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
