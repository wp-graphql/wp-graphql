## register_graphql_connection( \$config )

The `register_graphql_connection( $config )` function is used to add a Connection to the WPGraphQL
Schema.

### \$config

The function accepts one argument, a `$config` array containing the following config:

-   **fromType: (required | string)** The name of the Type the connection is coming _from_
-   **toType: (required | string)** The name of the Type the connection is going _to_
-   **fromFieldName: (required | string)** The name of the field on the from Type that should resolve
    to the connection
-   **connectionTypeName: (string)** The name of the Connection Type. If not provided, the Type name will
    be derived from the `fromType` and `toType` names.
-   **resolve: (required | function)** The function that is used to resolve the connection
-   **resolveNode (function):** The function that is used to resolve an individual node within the
    connection (required for deferred resolution)
    -   **Note:** This arg is required for connections using Deferred resolvers
-   **connectionArgs (array):** Array of GraphQL input fields that will be added to the connection's
    "where" args
-   **connectionFields (array):** Array of GraphQL fields to expose as a field of the connection.

## Usage

The use of `register_graphql_connection( $config )` should be happen within the
`graphql_register_types` action, as that's when GraphQL builds the Schema. Since Connections require
a `fromType` and `toType`, the connection must be registered _after_ those types have been
registered. A lower priority (such as 99) will allow for other Types to be registered before the
connection references them.

## Example

The below snippet will add a connection to the WPGraphQL Schema, and will use the built-in
Post Object Connection Resolver, so it will return data, but it won't be limited to "the last week"
as the connection name implies.

### Register the connection

In this example, we define the following:

-   **fromType => 'RootQuery':** This tells GraphQL the connection will be coming from the RootQuery,
    which means we can query this connection at the root of the graph. This from Type could be any
    existing Type, and that Type is where the connection can be entered when querying.
-   **toType => 'Post':** This tells GraphQL the connection will resolve to nodes of the Post type.
    This can be configured to any existing Type in the Schema, but you have to hold up your end of the
    contract and resolve the connection to the Type promised.
-   **fromFieldName => 'postsFromThisWeek':** This is the field name that is added to the "fromType".
    In this case, the `RootQuery` type gets a field `postsFromThisWeek` added to it which resolves to
    the connection.
-   **connectionTypeName => 'PostsFromThisWeekConnection':** If this field is blank, the connection name
    would be derived from the `fromType` and `toType`. In this case, there's already a
    `RootQueryToPostConnection` in the Schema, which we _could_ resolve to, but it's probably safer to
    resolve to our own Connection Type so we could customize in a more isolated way down the road. You
    will now see (by browsing GraphiQL or similar) that our Schema includes a
    `PostsFromThisWeekConnection` Type
-   **resolve:** This is set to a function, like all resolve fields in the Schema. This function is
    what is executed when the connection is queried. In our case, we return the results of
    `\WPGraphQL\Data\DataSource::resolve_post_objects_connection`. (we'll look at customizing the
    resolver below).
-   **resolveNode:** This is set to a function, which receives and ID of a node. The Connection Resolver
    queries for and returns IDs of objects, and the `resolveNode` function is responsible for resolving
    the object based on the ID provided to it. Here, we are accepting an ID of a Post and using the
    `\WPGraphQL\Data\DataSource::resolve_post_object` to resolve it. This method makes use of Deferred
    resolution, allowing for our objects to be fetched all at once, instead of immediately when the
    resolver is called.

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', 'register_my_custom_graphql_connection', 99 );

function register_my_custom_graphql_connection() {
  $config = [
    'fromType' => 'RootQuery',
    'toType' => 'Post',
    'fromFieldName' => 'postsFromThisWeek',
    'connectionTypeName' => 'PostsFromThisWeekConnection',
    'resolve' => function( $id, $args, $context, $info ) {
      return \WPGraphQL\Data\DataSource::resolve_post_objects_connection( $id, $args, $context, $info, 'post' );
    },
    'resolveNode' => function( $id, $args, $context, $info ) {
      return \WPGraphQL\Data\DataSource::resolve_post_object( $id, $context );
    }
  ];
  register_graphql_connection( $config );
};
```

### Query the connection

Now that we have a connection registered to our Schema, we can query the following:

```graphql
{
	postsFromThisWeek(first: 3) {
		nodes {
			id
			title
			date
			link
		}
	}
}
```

### Connection Query Results

And get a result like so (of course, the data is relative to the content in your database):

```json
{
	"data": {
		"postsFromThisWeek": {
			"nodes": [
				{
					"id": "cG9zdDoxMzYz",
					"title": "New Post From This Week",
					"date": "2019-04-04 19:24:22",
					"link": "https://demowpgraphql.local/new-post/"
				},
				{
					"id": "cG9zdDox",
					"title": "Hello world!",
					"date": "2019-01-28 23:50:02",
					"link": "https://demowpgraphql.local/hello-world/"
				},
				{
					"id": "cG9zdDoxMDMx",
					"title": "Tiled Gallery",
					"date": "2013-03-15 17:23:27",
					"link": "https://demowpgraphql.local/tiled-gallery/"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

The problem with this is that we want to limit our connection to _just_ posts from this week, because
the connection is called `postsFromThisWeek`.

So, let's look at overriding the connection resolver.

### Custom Connection Resolvers

If we take a look at the `DataSource::resolve_post_objects_connection()` method, we can see it does
the following:

```php
public static function resolve_post_objects_connection( $source, array $args, AppContext $context, ResolveInfo $info, $post_type ) {
$resolver   = new \\WPGraphQL\\Data\\Connection\\PostObjectConnectionResolver( $source, $args, $context, $info, $post_type );
$connection = $resolver->get_connection();

return $connection;
```

It instantiates an new instance of `PostObjectConnectionResolver`, then asks for the `get_connection`
in response.

We want to modify the args of the underlying `\WP_Query` to limit posts to the last 7 days.

We can do so by removing the call to `DataSource::resolve_post_objects_connection()` and changing
our `resolve` field to look like the following:

```php
'resolve' => function( $id, $args, $context, $info ) {
    $resolver   = new \\WPGraphQL\\Data\\Connection\\PostObjectConnectionResolver( $source, $args, $context, $info, 'post' );
    $resolver->setQueryArg('date_query', [
        'after' => '1 week ago',
    ]);
    $connection = $resolver->get_connection();
    return $connection;
}
```

This will override the query_args configured by PostObjectConnectionResolver query args, which get passed to
`\WP_Query`, with a custom `date_query` query arg, limiting posts to just the last week.

Now, we can execute the same query:

```graphql
{
	postsFromThisWeek(first: 3) {
		nodes {
			id
			title
			date
			link
		}
	}
}
```

And we get results limited to the last 7 days! Amazing!

```json
{
	"data": {
		"postsFromThisWeek": {
			"nodes": [
				{
					"id": "cG9zdDoxMzYz",
					"title": "New Post From This Week",
					"date": "2019-04-04 19:24:22",
					"link": "https://demowpgraphql.local/new-post/"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```
