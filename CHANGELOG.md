# Changelog

## 1.1.1

## Bugfix

- ([#1670](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/1670)) Fixes a bug with querying pages that are set as to be the posts page

## 1.1.0

This release centers around updating code quality by implementing [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) checks. PHPStan is a tool that statically analyzes PHP codebases to detect bugs. This release centers around updating Docblocks and overall code quality, and implements automated tests to check code quality on every pull request.

## New

- Update PHPStan (Code Quality checker) to v0.12.64
- Increases PHPStan code quality checks to Level 8 (highest level).

## Bugfixes
- ([#1653](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/1653)) Fixes bug where WPGraphQL was explicitly setting `has_published_posts` on WP_Query but WP_Query does this under the hood already. Thanks @jmartinhoj!
- Fixes issue with Comment Model returning comments that are not associated with a Post object. Comments with no associated Post object are not public entities.
- Update docblocks to be compatible with PHPStan Level 8. 
- Removed some uncalled code
- Added early returns in some places to prevent unnecessary added execution

- Updates Theme tests to be more resilient for WP Core updates where new themes are introduced

### Bugfixes

- ([#1615](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/1615)) Fixes bug where fields added to the Schema that that were using get_post_meta() for Previews weren't always resolving properly.

### New Features
- Adds a setting to allow users to opt-in to tracking active installs of WPGraphQL.
- Removed old docs that used to be in this repo as markdown. Docs are now written in WordPress and the wpgraphql.com is a Gatsby site built from the content in WordPress and the [code in this repo](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com). Looking to contribute content to the docs? Open an issue on this repo or the wpgraphql.com repo and we'll work with you to get content updated. We have future plans to allow the community to contribute by writing content in the WordPress install, but for now, Github issues will do.
