# Changelog

## 1.16.0

### Upgrade Notice

**WPGraphQL Smart Cache**
For WPGraphQL Smart Cache users, you should update WPGraphQL Smart Cache to v1.2.0 when updating 
WPGraphQL to v1.16.0 to ensure caches continue to purge as expected.

**Cursor Pagination Updates**
This version fixes some behaviors of Cursor Pagination which _may_ lead to behavior changes in your application.

As with any release, we recommend you test in staging environments. For this release, specifically any 
queries you have using pagination arguments (`first`, `last`, `after`, `before`).

### Possible Breaking Change for some users

The work to introduce the `Connection` and `Edge` (and other) Interfaces required the `User.revisions` and `RootQuery.revisions` connection to
change from resolving to the `ContentRevisionUnion` type and instead resolve to the `ContentNode` type.

We believe that it's highly likely that most users will not be impacted by this change.

Any queries that directly reference the following types:

- `...on UserToContentRevisionUnionConnection`
- `...on RootQueryToContentRevisionUnionConnection`

Would need to be updated to reference these types instead:

- `...on UserToRevisionsConnection`
- `...on RootQueryToRevisionsConnection`

For example:

#### BEFORE

```graphql
{
  viewer {
    revisions {
      ... on UserToContentRevisionUnionConnection {
        nodes {
          __typename
          ... on Post {
            id
            uri
            isRevision
          }
          ... on Page {
            id
            uri
            isRevision
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  revisions {
    ... on RootQueryToContentRevisionUnionConnection {
      nodes {
        __typename
        ... on Post {
          id
          uri
          isRevision
        }
        ... on Page {
          id
          uri
          isRevision
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### AFTER

```graphql
{
  viewer {
    revisions {
      ... on UserToRevisionsConnection {
        nodes {
          __typename
          ... on Post {
            id
            uri
            isRevision
          }
          ... on Page {
            id
            uri
            isRevision
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  revisions {
    ... on RootQueryToRevisionsConnection {
      nodes {
        __typename
        ... on Post {
          id
          uri
          isRevision
        }
        ... on Page {
          id
          uri
          isRevision
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 1.12.0

### Upgrading

This release removes the `ContentNode` and `DatabaseIdentifier` interfaces from the `NodeWithFeaturedImage` Interface.

This is considered a breaking change for client applications using a `...on NodeWithFeaturedImage` fragment that reference fields applied by those interfaces. If you have client applications doing this (or are unsure if you do) you can use the following filter to bring back the previous behavior:

```php
add_filter( 'graphql_wp_interface_type_config', function( $config ) {
	if ( $config['name'] === 'NodeWithFeaturedImage' ) {
		$config['interfaces'][] = 'ContentNode';
		$config['interfaces'][] = 'DatabaseIdentifier';
	}
	return $config;
}, 10, 1 );
```

## 1.10.0

### Upgrading

PR ([#2490](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/2490)) fixes a bug that some users were using as a feature.

When a page is marked as the "Posts Page" WordPress does not resolve that page by URI, and this bugfix no longer will resolve that page by URI.

[Here](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/2486#issuecomment-1232169375), you can read more about why this change was made and find a snippet of code that will bring the old functionality back if you've built features around it.

## 1.9.0

### Upgrading

There are 2 changes that **might** require action when updating to 1.9.0.

1. ([#2464](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/2464))

When querying for a `nodeByUri`, if your site has the "page_for_posts" setting configured, the behavior of the `nodeByUri` query for that uri might be different for you.

Previously a bug caused this query to return a "Page" type, when it should have returned a "ContentType" Type.

The bug fix might change your application if you were using the bug as a feature.

2. ([#2457](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/2457))

There were a lot of bug fixes related to connections to ensure they behave as intended. If you were querying lists of data, in some cases the data might be returned in a different order than it was before.

For example, using the "last" input on a Comment or User query should still return the same nodes, but in a different order than before.

This might cause behavior you don't want in your application because you had coded around the bug. This change was needed to support proper backward pagination.

## 1.3.0

### Notable changes

Between this release and the prior release ([v1.2.6](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases/tag/v1.2.6)) includes changes to pagination under the hood.

While these releases correcting mistakes and buggy behavior, it's possible that workarounds have already been implemented either in the server or in client applications.

For example, there was a bug with `start/end` cursors being reversed for backward pagination.

If a client application were reversing the cursors to fix the issue, the reversal in the client will now _cause_ the issue.

It's recommended to test your applications against this release, _specifically_ in regards to pagination.

### New Features

- Adds a setting to allow users to opt-in to tracking active installs of WPGraphQL.
- Removed old docs that used to be in this repo as markdown. Docs are now written in WordPress and the wpgraphql.com is a Gatsby site built from the content in WordPress and the [code in this repo](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com). Looking to contribute content to the docs? Open an issue on this repo or the wpgraphql.com repo and we'll work with you to get content updated. We have future plans to allow the community to contribute by writing content in the WordPress install, but for now, Github issues will do.
